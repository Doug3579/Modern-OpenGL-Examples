If you're trying to learn OpenGL programming be aware that there's a LOT of outdated information on the Internet. A good rule of thumb is the presence of glBegin/glEnd commands: if you see these you can be sure it's outdated code. On the other hand any code that uses Vertex Array Objects can probably be considered \"modern,\" although this is not a guarantee.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
